# GroupMovie 

Too often groups become exhausted spending hours scrolling through Netflix, shuffling through Hulu, and skimming through Amazon Prime trying to find a movie to watch with friends, only to give up and call it a night. Finding a movie with a group quickly turns to a chore, while bored eyes turn to their phones. Users want an app to make choosing a movie to watch as a group enjoyable and easy; an app where each user can vote on their preferred movies while receiving as much information as possible about each movie in order to make an informed decision.
